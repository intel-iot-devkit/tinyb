This project aims to create clean, modern and easy to use Bluetooth GATT API
for C++, Java and other languages, using BlueZ over DBus.

Using TinyB
============

TinyB requires CMake 3.1+ for building and requires GLib/GIO 2.40+. It also
requires BlueZ with GATT profile activated, which is currently experimental (as
of BlueZ 5.37), so you might have to run bluetoothd with the -E flag. For
example, on a system with systemd (Fedora, poky, etc.) edit the
bluetooth.service file (usually found in /usr/lib/systemd/system/ or
/lib/systemd/system) and append -E to ExecStart line, restart the daemon with
systemctl restart bluetooth.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.sh}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last command will create the include/ and lib/ directories with a copy of
the headers and library objects respectively in your build location. Note that
doing an out-of-source build may cause issues when rebuilding later on.

Our cmake configure has a number of options, *cmake-gui* or *ccmake* can show
you all the options. The interesting ones are detailed below:

Changing install path from /usr/local to /usr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building debug build:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using clang instead of gcc:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cross-compiling on a different system:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-m32 -march=i586
-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING=-m32 -march=i586
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build Java bindings:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-DBUILDJAVA=ON
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build documentation run: 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
make doc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The hellotinyb example uses a [TI Sensor Tag](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/?INTC=SensorTag&HQS=sensortag)
from which it reads the ambient temperature. You have to pass the MAC address
of the Sensor Tag as a first parameter to the program.
