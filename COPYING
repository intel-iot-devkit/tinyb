Direct-BT Sub-Module License & Copyright
========================================
The MIT License (MIT) (see above)

Tinyb2's direct_bt imports certain information from Linux Kernel's BlueZ protocol stack,
allowing the use of these kernel services via system calls.
Therefore, the license has been aligned with this project.

Related files are
- <api/direct_bt/BTIoctl.hpp>,
- <api/direct_bt/HCIIoctl.hpp> and 
- <api/direct_bt/L2CAPIoctl.hpp>.

See Linus Torvalds's Linux Kernel license exception regarding kernel syscalls (ioctl):
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/LICENSES/exceptions/Linux-syscall-note>

NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel
 services by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use
 of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".

...

This documentation of our usage is certainly a better than GOOG's approach: 
<https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/bluetooth/+/eclair-release/bluez-clean-headers/bluetooth?autodive=0/>,
which removes all authorship and origin.
